```
Extend: Extends an existing fixed format VHD to a larger size <Size>.
        WARNING - this function is admin only and bypasses
        file system security.  The resulting VHD file will
        contain data which currently exists on the physical disk.

Repair: Repairs a broken Hyper-V snapshot chain where an administrator
        has expanded the size of the root VHD.  The base VHD will be
        returned to its original size. THIS MAY CAUSE DATA LOSS if the
        contents of the base VHD were changed after expansion.
